PouchDB snippets for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) that is designed to run well within the browser. Was created to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online.

To install through Package Control, search for [**PouchDB**](https://github.com/brenopolanski/pouchdb-sublime-snippets). If you still don't have Package Control in Sublime Text, [go get it](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation). If you insist to not install it, you can download the package and put it manually inside your Pacakages directory. It should work but will not update automatically.
